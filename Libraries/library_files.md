In this text file, are the links for the 3 libraries used in this project. They can all be downloaded from GitHub. In order to use in Arduino, for either [DHT11](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) or [BMP388](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BMP3XX) one follow these instructions:

    1) Click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner
    2) rename the uncompressed folder 'folder-name'. (Could be DHT or BMP)
    3) Check that the 'folder-name' folder contains folder-name.cpp and folder-name.h. 
    4) Place the 'folder-name' folder your /libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE

For ESP8266, follow the (instructions)[https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino] on GitHub
